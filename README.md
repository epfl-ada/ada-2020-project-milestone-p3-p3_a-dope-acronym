# Detecting Seasonal Patterns in User Movement  

## Abstract 

## Research Questions

Using the same datasets as in the paper, we will try to answer the following questions:
- How does human mobility fluctuate as a function of time throughout the year (e.g seasons, holidays, school, etc) ?
  - Do poeple travel further during certain times of the year?
  - Are they more likely to see friends at certain times?
  - Does their home location change during the year (e.g. summer house)?
- How does spacial distribution of check-ins fluctuate throughout the year?
  - Can we find spacial patterns and seasonal tourist destinations (e.g. ski resort, beaches)
  - Can we find groups of people (e.g. families, cultural gatherings) at certain times of the year?
